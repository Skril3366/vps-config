# Quick Start Guide

Get your VPS up and running with monitoring, authentication, and reverse proxy in under 30 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **VPS**: Ubuntu 20.04+ with 2GB RAM, public IP
- **Domain**: A domain with DNS access (pointing to your VPS IP)
- **Local tools**: `just`, `uv`, `docker` installed
- **SSH access**: Key-based SSH access to your VPS with sudo privileges

## Step 1: Initial Setup (5 minutes)

### Clone and Initialize
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd vps-config

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Verify setup
just validate
```

### Configure Your VPS Details
```bash
# Create production inventory
just setup

# Edit with your VPS details
vim ansible/inventories/production.yml
```

Edit the key values:
```yaml
all:
  hosts:
    vps:
      ansible_host: "YOUR_VPS_IP"
      ansible_user: "ubuntu"  # or your SSH user
      ansible_ssh_private_key_file: "~/.ssh/your_key"
  vars:
    domain_name: "yourdomain.com"
    letsencrypt_email: "admin@yourdomain.com"
```

### Test Connectivity
```bash
# Verify SSH connection to your VPS
just ping
# Should return: vps | SUCCESS => {"changed": false, "ping": "pong"}
```

## Step 2: Configure DNS (5 minutes)

Add these DNS records pointing to your VPS IP:

| Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| A | yourdomain.com | YOUR_VPS_IP | 300 |
| A | auth.yourdomain.com | YOUR_VPS_IP | 300 |
| A | grafana.yourdomain.com | YOUR_VPS_IP | 300 |
| A | prometheus.yourdomain.com | YOUR_VPS_IP | 300 |
| A | loki.yourdomain.com | YOUR_VPS_IP | 300 |

**Verify DNS propagation**:
```bash
# Check DNS resolution
nslookup auth.yourdomain.com
```

## Step 3: Configure Authentication (10 minutes)

**‚ö†Ô∏è This step is required before deployment!**

### Generate Secure Secrets
```bash
# Generate three random secrets (copy these!)
echo "JWT Secret: $(openssl rand -base64 32)"
echo "Session Secret: $(openssl rand -base64 32)"  
echo "Storage Key: $(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

### Generate Admin Password Hash
```bash
# Replace 'your-secure-password' with your actual password
just authelia-hash 'your-secure-password'
# Copy the entire hash output (starting with $argon2id$...)
```

### Create Environment File
```bash
# Create the environment file
mkdir -p ansible/inventories/production
cp .env.example ansible/inventories/production/.env

# Edit the environment file
vim ansible/inventories/production/.env
```

Update with your values:
```bash
# Use the secrets generated above (keep the quotes)
AUTHELIA_JWT_SECRET="your_generated_jwt_secret"
AUTHELIA_SESSION_SECRET="your_generated_session_secret"
AUTHELIA_STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your_generated_storage_key"

# Admin user details
AUTHELIA_ADMIN_USER=admin
AUTHELIA_ADMIN_DISPLAYNAME=Administrator
AUTHELIA_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com

# Password hash (NO QUOTES around the hash!)
AUTHELIA_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$your_hash_here
```

## Step 4: Test Locally (5 minutes)

```bash
# Test configuration locally with Docker
just test-local

# This will:
# 1. Create a test environment
# 2. Deploy all services
# 3. Run health checks
# 4. Report any issues
```

**Expected output**: All services should start successfully and pass health checks.

If there are issues, check:
- Environment file has correct values
- No syntax errors in configuration
- All required secrets are set

```bash
# Clean up test environment
just test-clean
```

## Step 5: Deploy to Production (5 minutes)

### Pre-deployment Checks
```bash
# Check Ansible syntax
just check

# Test what will be deployed (dry-run)
just dry-run
```

### Deploy All Services
```bash
# Deploy everything
just deploy

# Or with verbose output for troubleshooting
just deploy-verbose
```

**What happens during deployment**:
1. ‚úÖ System updates and package installation
2. ‚úÖ SSH hardening and firewall configuration  
3. ‚úÖ Docker installation and setup
4. ‚úÖ Service deployment (Authelia, Caddy, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
5. ‚úÖ SSL certificate acquisition
6. ‚úÖ Service integration and health checks

## Step 6: Verify Deployment (5 minutes)

### Run Health Checks
```bash
# Comprehensive health check
just health-check

# Expected: All checks should pass ‚úÖ
```

### Test Service Access

1. **Visit auth portal**: https://auth.yourdomain.com
   - Should show Authelia login page
   - Login with username `admin` and your password
   - Complete 2FA setup with your authenticator app

2. **Test protected services**:
   - **Grafana**: https://grafana.yourdomain.com
   - **Prometheus**: https://prometheus.yourdomain.com
   - **Loki**: https://loki.yourdomain.com
   - All should redirect to auth portal if not logged in

### Check SSL Certificates
```bash
# Verify HTTPS is working
curl -I https://auth.yourdomain.com
# Should return: HTTP/2 200 with valid SSL certificate
```

## Quick Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] **DNS**: All subdomains resolve to VPS IP
- [ ] **SSH**: Can still access VPS via SSH
- [ ] **HTTPS**: All services accessible via HTTPS
- [ ] **Authentication**: Can login at auth.yourdomain.com
- [ ] **2FA**: Two-factor authentication setup completed
- [ ] **Services**: All protected services accessible after authentication
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Grafana shows system metrics
- [ ] **Health**: `just health-check` passes all tests

## Common Quick Fixes

### Can't Login to Authelia
```bash
# Check username (use 'admin', not email)
# Check password hash generation
just authelia-hash 'your-password'

# Reset bans if account is locked
just reset-authelia-bans
```

### Services Return 502 Errors
```bash
# Check all containers are running
just ssh "docker ps"

# Restart problematic service
just restart <service-name>

# Check logs
just logs <service-name>
```

### SSL Certificate Issues
```bash
# Check DNS is pointing to correct IP
dig A yourdomain.com

# Restart Caddy to retry certificate
just restart caddy

# Check Caddy logs for certificate errors
just logs caddy | grep -i certificate
```

## Next Steps

Now that your VPS is running:

1. **Explore Grafana**: Check out the pre-configured dashboards
2. **Add applications**: See [Customization Guide](customization.md) to add your own services
3. **Set up monitoring**: Configure alerts and notifications
4. **Security review**: Review the [Security Guide](security.md)
5. **Backup setup**: Plan your backup strategy

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check logs**: `just logs <service-name>`
2. **Health check**: `just health-check`
3. **Review troubleshooting**: [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md)
4. **Check configuration**: [Configuration Guide](configuration.md)
